# Define a test named `NAME'.
#
# This macro will
#
# * create a binary from user-provided source files and common.hh
# * link it against Boost
# * add it to the test suite.
#
# The test should #include the common.hh header

# the "use_model" subfolder is included once per tested model. The tests
# defined within it should use the "CURRENT_MODEL" macro to use the
# corresponding solver.
# For each inclusion of the folder, a different binary folder is used. It acts
# as a namespace for CMake. This makes it possible to use different values
# for "CURRENT_MODEL" when calling add_definitions(), without conflicts.
